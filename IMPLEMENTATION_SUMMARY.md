# Model Customization Implementation Summary

## Project Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All phases of the Gemini MCP Server Model Customization project have been successfully completed as of May 10, 2025.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Code Changes
- ✅ Updated `server.ts` to support model customization with environment variables
- ✅ Modified `handlers.ts` to accept the GoogleGenerativeAI instance and support model selection
- ✅ Added a getModel method in handlers.ts to switch models at runtime
- ✅ Updated handleGenerate and handleStream methods to use the requested model
- ✅ Included model name in response metadata for both generate and stream
- ✅ Updated protocol types to include model parameter
- ✅ Updated main index.ts file to read model from environment

### 2. Documentation
- ✅ Created CHANGELOG.md with version history
- ✅ Updated version in package.json to 1.1.0
- ✅ Updated README.md with model selection information
- ✅ Updated examples.md with model selection examples

### 3. Tests
- ✅ Created new test files for model selection functionality:
  - handlers.model.test.ts - Tests model selection in handlers
  - server.model.test.ts - Tests environment variable handling and server configuration
- ✅ Fixed ESM compatibility issues in test files
- ✅ Implemented dynamic port allocation to prevent test port conflicts

### 4. Build and Deployment
- ✅ Fixed ESM import path issues by adding .js extensions to all relative imports
- ✅ Successfully built the TypeScript project with `npm run build`
- ✅ Committed and pushed changes to the repository
- ✅ Package is ready for optional npm publishing

## Implementation Details

### ESM Module Configuration
We resolved import path issues by adding `.js` extensions to all relative imports in the source files, which is required for ESM modules with `Node16` moduleResolution. This ensures proper TypeScript compilation and JavaScript module loading at runtime.

### Testing Improvements
- Updated Jest configuration in `jest.config.mjs` to work properly with ESM modules
- Implemented dynamic port allocation to prevent conflicts when running server tests in parallel
- Fixed WebSocket type issues by properly importing WebSocketServer

### Usage Instructions

Test with different model configurations in Claude desktop settings:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gemini": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:/projects/Repos/AI-tools/mcp-server-gemini/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "GEMINI_MODEL": "gemini-1.5-pro"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or test with runtime model selection in API requests:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "generate",
  "params": {
    "prompt": "Explain quantum computing",
    "model": "gemini-1.5-flash"
  }
}
```
