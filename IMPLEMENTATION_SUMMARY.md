# Model Customization Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Code Changes
- ✅ Updated `server.ts` to support model customization with environment variables
- ✅ Modified `handlers.ts` to accept the GoogleGenerativeAI instance and support model selection
- ✅ Added a getModel method in handlers.ts to switch models at runtime
- ✅ Updated handleGenerate and handleStream methods to use the requested model
- ✅ Included model name in response metadata for both generate and stream
- ✅ Updated protocol types to include model parameter
- ✅ Updated main index.ts file to read model from environment

### 2. Documentation
- ✅ Created CHANGELOG.md with version history
- ✅ Updated version in package.json to 1.1.0
- ✅ Updated README.md with model selection information
- ✅ Updated examples.md with model selection examples

### 3. Tests
- ✅ Created new test files for model selection functionality:
  - handlers.model.test.ts - Tests model selection in handlers
  - server.model.test.ts - Tests environment variable handling and server configuration

## Issues to Resolve

1. **ESM Import Path Issues**:
   - The project uses ESM modules with Node16 moduleResolution, requiring explicit file extensions
   - Would need to update all import paths with .js extensions or modify tsconfig.json

2. **WebSocket Type Issues**:
   - Fixed WebSocket.Server to WebSocketServer in server.ts

3. **Test Configuration**:
   - Jest configuration needs updating to work properly with ESM modules
   - There is an issue with port conflicts in the server tests

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Build Issues**:
   - Update import paths in all files to work with ESM modules
   - Alternatively, modify tsconfig.json to support imports without extensions

2. **Fix and Run Tests**:
   - Update test configuration for ESM compatibility
   - Fix port conflicts in server tests
   - Use unique ports for each test or mock HTTP server

3. **Package and Deploy**:
   - Once build issues are fixed, test the package locally
   - Commit changes and create pull request
   - Publish to npm or GitHub packages

## Test the Implementation

Test with different model configurations:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gemini": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:/projects/Repos/AI-tools/mcp-server-gemini/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "GEMINI_MODEL": "gemini-1.5-pro"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or test with runtime model selection:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "generate",
  "params": {
    "prompt": "Explain quantum computing",
    "model": "gemini-1.5-flash"
  }
}
```
