# Gemini MCP Server Model Customization Project - Completion Report

**Date:** May 10, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Version:** 1.1.0

## Project Summary

The Gemini MCP Server Model Customization project has been successfully completed. All planned features have been implemented, tested, and documented. The project adds dynamic model selection capabilities to the MCP Server for Google's Gemini API, allowing users to specify which Gemini model to use either through environment variables or runtime request parameters.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Environment Variable Model Selection**
   - Users can specify which Gemini model to use by setting the `GEMINI_MODEL` environment variable
   - Configuration is applied at server startup
   - Default falls back to 'gemini-pro' if not specified

2. **Runtime Model Selection**
   - Clients can specify a model in their JSON-RPC requests
   - Supports both 'generate' and 'stream' endpoints
   - Model parameter takes precedence over environment variable

3. **Model Information in Response**
   - Response metadata includes the model used for generation
   - Provides transparency about which model processed each request

4. **Improved Documentation**
   - Updated README with model selection information
   - Added examples for different configuration methods
   - Created a comprehensive changelog

## Testing Results

Testing was performed with both older and newer Gemini models:

| Model | Environment Variable Test | Request Parameter Test |
|-------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| gemini-pro | ✅ Success | ✅ Success |
| gemini-1.5-pro | ✅ Success | ✅ Success |
| gemini-1.5-flash | ✅ Success | ✅ Success |
| gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06 | ✅ Success | ✅ Success |
| gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17 | ✅ Success | ✅ Success |

All models were successfully loaded and could be switched dynamically at runtime.

## Implementation Challenges Resolved

1. **ESM Import Path Issues**
   - Resolved by adding `.js` extensions to all relative imports
   - Required for proper TypeScript compilation with Node16 module resolution

2. **Test Configuration Updates**
   - Updated Jest configuration for ESM compatibility
   - Implemented dynamic port allocation to prevent test conflicts

3. **WebSocket Type Issues**
   - Fixed WebSocket import and type definitions

## Final Deliverables

1. **Code Changes**
   - Updated server.ts, handlers.ts, protocol.ts, and index.ts with model customization support
   - Fixed all ESM import paths across the codebase

2. **Documentation**
   - Created CHANGELOG.md documenting version 1.1.0
   - Updated README.md with model selection information
   - Added examples.md with model selection examples

3. **Tests**
   - Created handlers.model.test.ts and server.model.test.ts
   - Fixed existing tests for compatibility

4. **Build and Deployment**
   - Successfully built the project with TypeScript
   - Committed all changes to the repository
   - Ready for optional npm publishing

## Usage Instructions

### Configuration via Environment Variables

```powershell
# PowerShell
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
$env:GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"
$env:PORT="3006"  # Optional
npm run start
```

### Runtime Model Selection in Requests

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "generate",
  "params": {
    "prompt": "What's new in your latest version?",
    "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17"
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

The project has successfully met all its objectives. The MCP Server now supports model customization through both environment variables and request parameters, providing users with flexibility in choosing which Gemini model to use for their AI applications. The code is well-documented, tested, and ready for production use.
